**BCCD: Blood Cell Count and Detection** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the medical industry.

The dataset consists of 364 images with 4888 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *WBC*, *RBC*, and *Platelets*.

Each image in the BCCD dataset has bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (72 images), *val* (87 images), and *train* (205 images). The dataset was released in 2018.
